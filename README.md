## Stock Android Privacy & Security Guide
#### Guide on how to reduce data collection on Android, while still enjoying it's security model.

This repository consolidates information on how to balance privacy and security while using a stock (or close to stock) Android version. 

This will guide you on how to neuter invasive software from Android devices, granting some level of privacy and decreasing battery consumption, while keeping the Android secuirty model intact and it's Quality-of-Life software and stability. The changes applied are not complex, and are offered within Android's and Google's Settings. I will explain my reasoning as to what changes should be applied throught the guide.

##### Intro:
Before we start, I would like to state that this guide is intended to be applied to devices that have **close-to-stock ROMs**, such as Motorola devices, but are also applicable to Google Pixel.

Why Motorola, you ask? Why, Pixels are not readly available on markets outside of the US and the EU. As such, I am making this guide thinking of those who do not have the chance to buy Pixel devices. While Motorola **is** owned by Lenovo at the time of writing, and as such likely has invasive regional practices, it also offers a ROM that is closest to stock and affordable phones worldwide with not much bloatware shipped by default.

##### Preparations:
First things first, we will do what many privacy advocates consider to be blasphemy: We will create a new Google Account. I know, I know, Google is not privacy respecting, yada, yada. We cannot, however, sacrifice security in the name of privacy, and Android's bleeding edge security features actually require your Google login to work. We are going to take advantage of those features, and of the privacy toggles available on Android.

###### Create you Google Account:

To create your Google account, consider the following:
- Use a computer for this. Open Private Mode / Incognito Mode.
- When creating a new Google account for personal use, choose a generic name (no surname) and birthday. For gender, choose "Prefer not to say".
- When you are asked to create a new gmail address, choose "Use Existing Address", and enter a trusted email provider, such as Proton or Tuta.

Now, after you have created your account, click on the user bubble at the corner and then on "Manage your Google Account". Notice the menu at the left of your Google Account settings page. We are going to be toggleing some options there.

###### The "Data and Privacy" Menu:

- Scroll down to the "History Configuration" section. There, pause all of your History.
- Scroll just a bit more to the "Personalised Ads" section and open it on a new tab. There, turn off Personalised Ads, right at the start of the webpage. Then, close the tab.
- Below "Personalised Ads", open "Partner Ads Configuration" in a new tab. There, turn off all the seetings that are available to you. Mind the "Configurations Associated to your Google Account" section.
- To the side of "Personalised Ads", open "Personalised Results on Search" on a new tab. Turn off "Show Personalised Results".
- Scroll just a bit to the "Google Fit Privacy" section. There, enter each section and turn off all settings. After that, close the tabs and turn your attention once more to the left side menu.
