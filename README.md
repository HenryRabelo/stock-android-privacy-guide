## Stock Android Privacy & Security Guide
#### Guide on how to reduce data collection on Android, while still enjoying it's security model.

This repository consolidates information on how to balance privacy and security while using a stock (or close to stock) Android version. 

This will guide you on how to neuter invasive software from Android devices, granting some level of privacy and decreasing battery consumption, while keeping the Android secuirty model intact and it's Quality-of-Life software and stability. The changes applied are not complex, and are offered within Android's and Google's Settings. I will explain my reasoning as to what changes should be applied throught the guide.

##### Intro:
Before we start, I would like to state that this guide is intended to be applied to devices that have **close-to-stock ROMs**, such as Motorola devices, but are also applicable to Google Pixel.

Why Motorola, you ask? Why, Pixels are not readly available on markets outside of the US and the EU. As such, I am making this guide thinking of those who do not have the chance to buy Pixel devices. While Motorola **is** owned by Lenovo at the time of writing, and as such likely has invasive regional practices, it also offers a ROM that is closest to stock and affordable phones worldwide with not much bloatware shipped by default.

##### Preparations:
First things first, we will do what many privacy advocates consider blasphemy: We will create a new Google Account.
